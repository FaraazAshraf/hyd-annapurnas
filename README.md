Android application to search for Annapurna Canteen centres within Hyderabad urban limits

This app has two ways of searching for Annapurna centres:
1- searching for the 5 nearest centres to the user's current location. This requires location permissions to be enabled.
2- the user can also search for the centres within a GHMC circle

I initially created this app (and one more) because I wanted to learn about how Fragments worked in Android. The initial app was built on a single Activity and everything else was done on Fragments. I found it very messy though so in update 1.2 I have removed all Fragments from the app. (well, except the GoogleMaps one)
